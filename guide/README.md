## Suggested Strategy for LeetCode
- Crack each levels one by one following the order introduced in res. 2.
- For each level, get the LeetCode problems set from res. 3.
- And following the difficulty and frequency order described in res.1 (from easy to hard, from the most frequent to the least).
- If a problem was not evaluated in res.1, you can determine its priority by LeetCode official difficulty, as well as the description about that problem.
